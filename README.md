#Android MVP & shared navigation example
Though the name is self explanatory, the main objective of this project is to offer a simple view of a
MVP Android application having a shared navigation drawer between components.

#MVP
MVP stands for Model - View - Presenter, referring to a software pattern that aims to decouple the presentation layer from the logic.
